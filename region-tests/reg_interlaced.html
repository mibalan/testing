		<h1>A little history</h1>
		<p class='firstPara'>In reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, in June 1982, several countries brought a decision to deploy their troops in the country in order to separate the combatants and attempt to establish peace and order. According to this decision, from 11 August 1982, US, French, and Italian units started arriving in Beirut, establishing the basis for what later became known as the “Multi-National Force” (MNF). The first to arrive were French paras of the Foreign Legion, flown in directly from Corsica aboard Transall transport aircraft of the ET-64 already on 19 August. Six days later the first US Marines arrived, supported by the French carrier Foch (R-99), and its Super Etendards and Crusaders.</p>
		<h1>The Flight into Disaster</h1>
		<p>The situation reached the boiling point with an IDF/AF strike against the Syrian SAM-sites in Balbek, on 16 November, which resulted in quite some casualties on the Syrian side, but also saw one of Israeli Kfirs being shot down over Bhamdoun. The pilot ejected safely and fell directly into the British positions near Beirut. The Israelis came back on 3 December, striking Syrian SAMs with a larger group of F-4E Phantom IIs and Kfirs, which delivered a very precise attack this time. This happened in the same moment two F-14As of the VF-32 were in the area on a reconnaissance mission, and therefore it was actually no surprise when the Syrians fired more than ten different SAMs against the Tomcats. The Tomcats, one of them equipped with a TARPS-container, were underway at 3.5000ft and over 960km/h, and could thus barely be hit from the ground. But, their crews noticed several SA-7s fired at them, and they were eventually forced to abort their mission. The U. S. Navy, however, saw this as another provocation: having finally a clear target at which it could hit back, it was clear that an answer was about to be delivered.</p>
		<p>On the same evening, Rear Admiral Jerry Tuttle, the commander of the Task Force 60 – which now included two carriers, the USS Independence and USS J.F. Kennedy, as the USS Eisenhower was ordered back to the USA) – was given the order to prepare a retaliation strike. However, the issue of this operation almost immediately became a matter of several controversies. Tuttle, of course, has left the planning to the teams of the units embarked aboard the two carriers, foremost Cdr. John J Mazach of the CVW-3, aboard USS Kennedy, and Cdr. Ed "Honiak" Andrews of the CVW-6, aboard USS Independence, and the whole following night these have worked very hard in order to properly plan the action and prepare their aircraft. On the early morning of 4 December 1984, however, a new order arrived from Washington, which included very specific instructions about the targets that were to be attacked, weapons to be used, as well as the time-point of the strike: instead of attacking at 1100 AM, the USN fighters were ordered to hit already at 0545AM, and to fly in at a level of 6.000m instead at a low altitude! It remains unclear who was the person that issued these orders, but the fact is that this had to lead straight into a disaster. </p>
		<p>The instructions from Washington could not be ignored by R.Adm. Tuttle and his officers: Tuttle had excellent reputation within the USN, for being a perfectionist and completing immense amounts of work within the shortest period of time. He was not ready to permit anything to went wrong with the operation, but he had to obey his orders. The problem was that they were received barely 30 minutes before the point at which the planes had to start in order to reach their targets by 0545AM. The problem was also that all the aircraft were already armed: Mazach and Andrews planned Kennedy to launch eight A-7s, each armed with 12 Mk.83s, and Independence to add four aircraft armed with Mk.7 Rockeye CBUs, filled with APAM (anti-personnel/anti-material) bomblets), and the whole package to be supported by at least two EA-6Bs and several F-14As. This had to be changed on a short notice, however, and the aircraft re-armed, as well as additional aircraft armed for the mission - as per order from Washington. The following chaos on the decks of USS Independence and USS Kennedy was unimaginable: pilots had to be awakened several hours earlier than planned, and then brought to their aircraft almost without any briefing: Mazach was only able to give them a short briefing of barely five minutes. The “red-shirts” - weapons specialists that care about the armanent of the aircraft - were rushing new trolleys with bombs from the ammunition depots deep inside the ships, and moving from one plane to the other, removing already prepared weapons and attempting to mount new ones. They had not had the slightest chance to properly arm the aircraft, however, as there was obviously not enough time. The case of Lt.Cdr. Tom Corey is known, who - after noticing that his aircraft was not loaded, but saw a stack of Mk.83s parked on their trolley near the ship's bridge - simply ordered few "red shirts" to hang a TER with three of the bombs under his aircraft! Eventually, several pilots had to start into the attack armed only with two – instead of a full complement of 12 or 16 bombs: in fact, only one aircraft, an A-6E of the VA-85, took-off carrying the assigned bomb-load!</p>
