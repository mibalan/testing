Issues with regions:
	* @regions not working (not implemented?)
	* regions pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) not working (not implemented?)
		[Filed bug #80163]
	* region-break-(after|before): avoid does not seem to work (at least not the way I expect it to)
		- they're just hints, not imperative declarations (however, I couldn't find a usecase where region-break-after would make a difference)
	* -webkit-region-overflow in CSS vs. webkitRegionOverflow
		[TSK sent mail]

Conceptual issues:
	* why regions that have top & bottom / left & right specified don't work if there's no width / height given? (it's really difficult to get a nice flexible layout when you have to know in advance the dimensions of the boxes for the regions)
		- [FIXED] That's what CSS flex-box is about
		- would it be OK to have the regions inside another container that's positioned as above? (looks messy but should get the job done)
			o yes, that's the (TSK) recommended way to do it
